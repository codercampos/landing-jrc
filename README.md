## About
This project was created to help someone complete their social work hours and graduate with a master's degree. Although the project was paid for, I want to archive this project and leave it for public use, both the template and the modifications made to it.

You can take the template, modify it, and distribute it as you wish, as long as you credit this repository.

I disclaim any legal repercussions and/or misuse of this information.

Be proffesional and honest, give credit to authors or people who help you.
